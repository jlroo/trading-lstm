# LSTM in Trading
Predicting trading strategies using LSTM. 
# Motivation
This project shows how LSTM based deep neural networks can be applied to predict time series financial data.
“The average reduction in error rates obtained by LSTM is between 84 - 87 percent when compared to ARIMA indicating the superiority of LSTM to ARIMA. Furthermore, it was noticed that the number of training times, known as "epoch" in deep learning, has no effect on the performance of the trained forecast model and it exhibits a truly random behavior.”

# Frameworks
```bash
* NumPy (1.16.2)
* Matplotlib (3.0.2)
* TensorFlow (1.13.1)
* Pandas (0.23.4)
* h5py (2.8.0)
```

### Stage two (March24-March31):
- Modify the last week notebook to meet the requirement of outline
  - Add citation
  - Paraphrase the contend in out own manner
  - Add new images to illustarte concepts
 
- Introduce REAMDME_private

- Modify the Outline of REAMDME

- Push Notebook_stage_two to github

- To do: 
  - Modify Notebook 2 to only include data preparation
  - Rewrite code, comments, and explanation in notebook 2
  - Ensure correct citation and format of following notebooks
  
### Stage Three (April1-April9):
- Read the code and understand the data format
  - Try to import HDF5 into PyTorch
  - Push data to github
  - Read the TensorFlow Version of the code

- Implement LSTM in PyTorch
  - Import data and apply data augmentation
  - Override LSTM modole in pyTorch and have one more fully connected layer
  - Train and Test Data with timing
  
 ### Stage Four (April20):

# LSTM in Trading(For group member only)

## Stage two (March24-March31):
- Modify the last week notebook to meet the requirement of outline
  - Add citation
  - Paraphrase the contend in out own manner
  - Add new images to illustarte concepts
 
- Introduce REAMDME_private

- Modify the Outline of REAMDME

- Push Notebook_stage_two to github

- To do: 
  - Modify Notebook 2 to only include data preparation
  - Rewrite code, comments, and explanation in notebook 2
  - Ensure correct citation and format of following notebooks
  
## Stage Three (April1-April9):
- Read the code and understand the data format
  - Try to import HDF5 into PyTorch
  - Push data to github
  - Read the TensorFlow Version of the code

- Implement LSTM in PyTorch
  - Import data and apply data augmentation
  - Override LSTM modole in pyTorch and have one more fully connected layer
  - Train and Test Data with timing
  
    
## Stage Four (April10-April17):
- Reproduce the code and make it runnable
  - Replace the deprcated codes
  - Run the code with 15 epochs and compare the results
  - Get a correlation about 0.04 which is fit into the prediction

    "We could scatter-plot actual returns over the predicted returns, however correlation is not visually apparent on scatter plots when the correlation is below 20-30%. The correlation we achieve in this signal is much weaker which is typical of modern financial markets. Correlations which we often observe in other applications of predictive models are all but impossible in the financial markets which are highly efficient (simply put, unpredictable). If we imagine that someone has a signal with correlation of 30% using leverage the person would soon get extremely rich - and the observed signal (inefficiency) would disappear from the market.\n",

    "In order to visually assess the signal, we split out of sample data points into buckets based on the value of predicted returns. We then compute per-bucket mean actual returns. Then we plot mean actual returns (Y axis) against predicted returns (X axis). We thus plot one point per bucket. By taking mean value, we average out the variance within each bucket and uncover the predictive value of the signal."

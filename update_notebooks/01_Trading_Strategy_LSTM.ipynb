    "\n",
    "**Trading Strategy:** A set of objective rules defining the conditions that must be met for a trade entry and exit to occur. Trading strategies include specifications for trade entries, including trade filters and triggers, as well as rules for trade exits, money management, timeframes, order types, and other relevant information. A trading strategy, if based on quantifiably specifications, can be analyzed based on historical data to project future performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instrument:** An instrument is a tradeable asset or negotiable item such as a security, commodity, derivative or index, or any item that underlies a derivative. An instrument is a means by which something of value is transferred, held or accomplished.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security:** It is a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (via stock), a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation (represented by owning that entity's bond), or rights to ownership as represented by an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stock**: A stock is a type of security that signifies ownership in a corporation and represents a claim on part of the corporation's assets and earnings. It is delivered in the units of shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Share**: Shares are units of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Position (Long)**: A long (or long position) is the buying of a security such as a stock, commodity or currency with the expectation that the asset will rise in value. Trader normally has no plan to sell the security in the near future. A key component of long position investment is the ownership of the stock or bond.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Short Position (Short)**: A short, or short position, is a directional trading or investment strategy where the investor sells shares of borrowed stock in the open market. The expectation of the investor is that the price of the stock will decrease over time, at which point the he will purchase the shares in the open market and return the shares to the broker which he borrowed them from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return**: A return is the gain or loss of a security in a particular period. The return consists of the income and the capital gains relative on an investment, and it is usually quoted as a percentage. The general rule is that the more risk you take, the greater the potential for higher returns and losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fundamental Analysis:** It is a method of evaluating a security in an attempt to measure its intrinsic value, by examining related economic, financial and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect the security's value, including macroeconomic factors such as the overall economy and industry conditions, and microeconomic factors such as financial conditions and company management. For instance, for stocks and equity instruments, this method uses revenues, earnings, future growth, return on equity, profit margins and other data to determine a company's underlying value and potential for future growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Analysis:** It is the evaluation of securities by means of studying statistics generated by market activity, such as past prices and volume. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security's intrinsic value but instead use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that may suggest what a stock will do in the future."
